## Overview
The **YOLO8 Clothing Detection** project utilizes the YOLOv8 model to detect clothing items from various classes in images. A key feature of this project is its ability to detect all parts of a single clothing item, trained specifically on marketplace data for enhanced accuracy and relevance.

## Data

The dataset used for training the **YOLO8 Clothing Detection** model consists of a diverse collection of clothing images spanning 13 distinct classes. These images serve as the foundation for the model's learning process, enabling it to accurately identify and localize various clothing items.

### Example Images
The following images provide examples of the data used for training and evaluation:

</p>

These examples showcase the diversity of clothing items and styles present in the dataset, ensuring that the model is exposed to a wide range of scenarios during training. The annotations and labels associated with each image enable the model to learn the distinctive features and characteristics of each clothing class.

## Features
- **Multi-Class Detection**: Detects clothing items from a comprehensive set of classes.
- **Part Detection**: Identifies all parts of a single clothing item, providing detailed insights into each detected item.
- **Marketplace Data Training**: The model is trained on a dataset sourced from online marketplaces, ensuring relevance to real-world applications.
